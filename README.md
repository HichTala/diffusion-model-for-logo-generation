## Motivation 

Creating logos for both commercial and artistic purposes is a complex task, historically assigned to humans. We are seeing these on a daily-basis : in the streets, in public transports, in TV advertisement and in almost every man-made objects.

We then can easily notice some usual patterns in logo design (shape, color, text...) related to the activity the logo is supposed to stand for. 

As we are aware of how competitive new Diffusion Models are, we wonder if it was possible to use them for this purpose. 

This could help :

* Save **time**
* Save **money**
* Be **accessible** (no design competences required)
